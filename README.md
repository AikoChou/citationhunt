## CitationHunt

CitationHunt is a simple tool for finding unsourced statements in the English
Wikipedia, currently hosted at
[https://citationhunt.herokuapp.com/](http://citationhunt.herokuapp.com/).

This repository contains the full server and client code. The
[scripts/](https://github.com/guilherme-pg/citationhunt/tree/master/scripts)
directory contains all the scripts used for processing Wikipedia dumps.
Hopefully they will be illustrative and reusable for similar applications.
